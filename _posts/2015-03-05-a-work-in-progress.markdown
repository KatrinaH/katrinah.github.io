Pardon the dust! This site is a work in progress. Follow along with me as I build out this site using [Jekyll] hosted with [Github Pages].

Jekyll is a blog-aware, static site generator. (No database necessary!)

The [Jekyll docs] provide a lot of information so I won't repeat what you can find over there. 

Currently, this site is using the basic Jekyll theme rolled into the installation. I want to use a framework and am leaning heavily towards [Bourbon and Neat]. 

I'm going to post notes on dev, random bits, and any other information I think may be helpful.

Why publish before I'm ready? Well, If I waited until I was ready, perfecting every little detail, then I probably wouldn't have published anything for months! I've sat on this domain (my legal name) for over a year!
